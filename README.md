## Creation notes

Most of code in this repository was created as part of programming course. It was live coded while explaining purpose of the code and showing examples of usage. This is not all of the code produced but only what was left in the end of lecture.

## Purpose

Purpose of this repo is to store code written in lectures. So students can review it. So value for self learning from this is quite limited.
